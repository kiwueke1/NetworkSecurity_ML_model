k# NetworkSecurity

The `NetworkSecurity` project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline aimed at analyzing network traffic data for security insights. Some features of our data set includes URL_Length, DNSRecord, HTTPS_token etc and we use these features to train a model that predicts if the traffic is malicious or not.

This repository uses object-oriented programming and is structured to enable modularity, scalability, and ease of development. It is implemented in Python and organized into components, utilities, and other helper scripts.

## **Project Structure**

The project is divided into several directories, each with a specific purpose:

### **1. `networksecurity`**
The core of the project, containing all the essential modules for building and running the machine learning pipeline.

#### Subdirectories:
- **`cloud/`**: Contains modules for cloud-related functionalities. Currently empty, serving as a placeholder.
- **`components/`**: Implements core pipeline components like data ingestion, transformation, validation, and model training.
  - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles fetching, cleaning, and preparing data.
  - `data_transformation.py`: Performs feature engineering and transformation.
  - `data_validation.py`: Ensures the integrity and quality of data.
  - `model_trainer.py`: Handles the training and evaluation of machine learning models.
- **`constant/`**: Includes configuration constants used throughout the project.
  - **`training_pipeline/`**: Contains configurations for the training pipeline.
- **`entity/`**: Defines entities such as `artifact_entity.py` and `config_entity.py` used to standardize data structures.
- **`exception/`**: Implements custom exceptions for handling errors gracefully.
- **`logging/`**: Provides a centralized logging mechanism for the project.
- **`pipeline/`**: Implements the machine learning pipeline logic.
  - `training_pipeline.py`: Orchestrates the training pipeline.
  - `batch_prediction.py`: Placeholder for batch inference logic.
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions and helper scripts for common tasks.
  - **`main_utils/`**: General-purpose utilities.
  - **`ml_utils/`**: Machine learning-specific utilities, including:
    - `metric/`: Handles metrics for model evaluation (e.g., `classification_metric.py`).
    - `model/`: Defines model-related utilities like `estimator.py`.

### **2. Root-Level Files**
- **`app.py`**: Main entry point for running the application, including API endpoints.
- **`main.py`**: Orchestrates the training pipeline.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies for the project.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the containerization process for the project.
- **`.env`**: Contains environment variables for configuring the application.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).

### **Deployment instructions**
This project is packaged as a docker container and deployed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) of this code base is automated using Github Actions.

#### How It Works
- **`Trigger:` The workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch.
- **`Continuous Integration:`
- ***Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
- ***Push the image to an AWS ECR repository.
- **Continuous Deployment:
- **Pull the latest Docker image from ECR.
- **Stop any running containers with the same name.
- **Run a new container with the updated image on the specified server.
- **Environment Variables
- **The following GitHub Secrets must be configured for the workflow:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key for authentication.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret access key.
AWS_REGION: AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI: Amazon ECR login URI (e.g., 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com).
ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME: The name of the ECR repository.
